## legend: Question 3 of 3

Look at the following circuits. Which of them would allow you to independently control the two LEDs?

\--- choices ---

- ( ) 1:
  ![circuit showing to LEDs connected in series to one programable pin and a ground pin](images/t-led-2.png)

\--- feedback ---

No. This circuit only uses one programmable pin, so the LEDs could not be controlled independently

\--- /feedback ---

- ( ) 2:
  ![circuit showing two LEDs sharing a single programmable pin through a single resistor, with their short legs going to different ground pins](images/t-led-3.png)
  \--- feedback ---

No. This circuit only uses one programmable pin, so the LEDs could not be controlled independently

\--- /feedback ---

- ( ) 3:
  ![circuit showing two LEDs sharing a single programmable pin, each through its own resistor. The short legs are connected to separate ground pins](images/t-led-4.png)
  \--- feedback ---

No. This circuit only uses one programmable pin, so the LEDs could not be controlled independently

\--- /feedback ---

- (x) 4:
  ![circuit showing two LEDs, each connected with the long leg going to a programable pin and the short leg going to a ground pin](images/t-led-1.png)

\--- feedback ---

Correct, each LED is connected to a different programmable pin and to a ground pin.
