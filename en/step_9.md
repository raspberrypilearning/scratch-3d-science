## Upgrade your project

Depending on how you designed your project, there are **lots** of ways you could improve and upgrade your work. 

You could:
+ Increase the number of LEDs on your project (remember to use the correct Pin numbers in your code!)
+ Create physical buttons to activate your LEDs and connect them to the Raspberry Pi (have a look at the [Stress Buster](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-stress-buster-with-scratch/3){:target="_blank"} project for reminders!)
+ Design and build more sturdy parts and enclosures for your display with better materials or components.

This example shows an Interactive World Map cut from plywood using a laser cutter and made into the top of a box which holds all the electronics. When the buttons are pressed, Scratch recognises this and uses the `Text to Speech` Scratch Extension to read out facts about the continent associated with the button. An LED also lights up the relevant continent inside the box, while the Scratch program displays a map backdrop on screen with the same continent coloured to match the LED.
