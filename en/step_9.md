## What can you do now?

If you are following the [Physical computing with Scratch and the Raspberry Pi path](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/physical-computing-with-scratch) pathway, you can move on to the [Musical instrument project](projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/scratchpc-musical-instrument)

If you want to have more fun exploring Scratch, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=scratch&curriculum%5B%5D=%201).
