## Introduction

In this project, you will combine your knowledge of using LEDs with your creative talents, to produce a scientific or natural 3D installation. You will create your own 3D crafted model, and add LEDs and maybe some sound, to craft your very own digital demonstration.

You will:
+ Connect multiple LEDs to a Raspberry Pi
+ Use multiple pins to control LEDs using Scratch
+ Control LEDs using random patterns or inputs


In order to complete this project you will need:
### Hardware

+ A Raspberry Pi computer
+ Jumper wires
+ LEDs
+ Crafting materials

### Software

+ Scratch 3 Desktop - **This project can not be completed using the online Scratch 3 editor**, and must be completed using a Raspberry Pi with the desktop version installed.
