## Challenge 

Depending on how you designed your project, there are **lots** of ways you could improve and upgrade your work. 

You could:

--- task ---

Increase the number of LEDs on your project (remember to use the correct Pin numbers in your code!)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Create physical buttons to activate your LEDs and connect them to the Raspberry Pi (have a look at the [Stress Buster](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-stress-buster-with-scratch/3){:target="_blank"} project for reminders!)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Design and build more sturdy construction for your cloud with better materials or components. Can you hang it from the ceiling?

Simulate your project on screen

If you have used an image from Scratch itself as part of your project, or a digital image of your own, you can import it into your Scratch project. Click on the **Choose a Sprite** icon and select **Upload Sprite**.

Add a photograph of your project

You could take photos of your project in action, and then import them as backdrops into your Scratch project, so that the image on the screen shows what is happening with the model. Here's an example of the thunder cloud project, using four photographs as different backdrops. The backdrop changes each time the LED comes on.

Add some sound effects to your project

You could add sound to your Scratch project, so that when the LEDs are turned on or off, Scratch plays a sound effect. For instance, these code blocks will start and stop a sound, in time with an LED turning on and off.

```blocks3
when flag clicked
wait (pick random (1) to (3))
turn LED (21 v) [on v] ::extension
start sound (Cymbal Echo v)
wait (pick random (1) to (3))
turn LED (21 v) [off v] ::extension
stop all sounds
```
