## Share your project

Because you have created a physical project, the best way to share your work is to record a video of your project in action. You could use a mobile phone to record your project working, and also show the code on your Raspberry Pi's screen.

Once you have created your video, you can share it on video hosting sites. The most popular is [YouTube](www.youtube.com), although if you are under 13 you will need to use the account of a responsible adult, with their permission.

Here's an example of one of the projects shown earlier, shared on YouTube.

Why not invite your friends to create a project? Let them know how you had fun.
